   ### Get Input
   la $a0, str1   # load string address into $a0
   li $v0, 4      # load print_string code into $v0
   syscall        # print str1

   li $v0, 5      # load read_int code into $v0
   syscall
   move $t0, $v0  # place the read value into register $t0

   la $a0, str2   # load address of string 2 into register $a0
   li $v0, 4      # load print_string code into $v0
   syscall        # print str2

   li $v0, 5      # load read_int code into $v0
   syscall
   move $t1, $v0  # place the read value into register $t1

   ### Performe calculation
   li  $t3, 2 	  #multiplies $t0 with 2
   mul $t0, $t0, $t3
   
   li  $t3, 3 	  #multiplies $t1 with 3
   mul $t1, $t1, $t3
   
   add $t2, $t1, $t0  # perform addition C = A + B
   
   ### Save to Mem
   sw  $t2, c	 #saves t2 in c

   ### Print result
   la $a0, str3   # load address of string 3 into register $a0
   li $v0, 4      # load print_string code into $v0
   syscall        # print str3

   li $v0, 1      # print_int A + B to the console window
   move $a0, $t2
   syscall

   la $a0, newline   # print the new line character to put the screen cursor to a newline
   li $v0, 4
   syscall

   ### Restart program with different input?
   la $a0, str4   # load address of string 5 into register $a0
   li $v0, 4      # load print_string code to console
   syscall        # print str4

   li $v0, 5      # read an integer from the console
   syscall

   bne $v0, $zero, main   # if not complete (i.e., not 0 was provided) then start at the beginning

   ### Exit
   li $v0, 10      # syscall code 10 for terminating the program
   syscall
